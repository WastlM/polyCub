\section{Changes in polyCub version 0.2-0 (2013-05-09)}{

\subsection{SYNOPSIS}{
  \itemize{
    \item This is the initial version of the \pkg{polyCub} package
    mainly built on functions previously maintained within the
    \CRANpkg{surveillance} package.
    \item It has more documentation and tests, and
    avoids the use of \CRANpkg{gpclib} as far as possible (using
    \CRANpkg{rgeos} instead)
  }
