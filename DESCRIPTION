Description: The following methods for cubature (numerical integration)
    over polygonal domains are currently implemented:
    the two-dimensional midpoint rule via
    as.im.function() from package 'spatstat' <http://spatstat.org/>,
    product Gauss cubature following Sommariva and Vianello (2007)
    <doi:10.1007/s10543-007-0131-2>,
    adaptive cubature for isotropic functions via line integrate()
    along the boundary as described in Meyer and Held (2014, Supplement B)
    <doi:10.1214/14-AOAS743>,
    and a method specific to the bivariate Gaussian density.
    For cubature over simple hypercubes, the packages 'cubature' and
    'R2Cuba' are more appropriate.
