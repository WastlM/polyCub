Description: A package providing methods for cubature (numerical integration)
             over polygonal domains. For cubature over simple hypercubes, the
             packages "cubature" and "R2cuba" are more appropriate.
             Currently, three (non-adaptive) cubature methods are implemented:
             the two-dimensional midpoint rule (a simple wrapper around
             spatstat::as.im.function), the product Gauss cubature proposed by
             Sommariva and Vianello (2007), and a quasi-exact method specific
             to the integration of the bivariate Gaussian density over
             polygonal domains.
